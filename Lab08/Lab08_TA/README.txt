1. Put "PATTERN.sv" and "PATTERN_bridge.sv" into /00_TESTBED/
2. Put "dram.dat" into /00_TESTBED/DRAM/
3. Set 3 types of latency in "pseudo_DRAM.sv" equal to "1" and then run 01, 02, 03.
4. Set 3 types of latency in "pseudo_DRAM.sv" equal to "20" and then run 01, 02, 03.

You have to pass both 3. & 4., or you will fail the Lab.
The setting of 4. will be used to calculate your performance.
